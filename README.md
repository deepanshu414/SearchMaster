## Usage/Examples

Here's how to use the `SearchMaster` library to search for a file named `example.txt`:

```python
# Importing search functions from the SearchMaster module
from SearchMaster import searchp, searchl

def main():
    # Perform a search using the `searchp` function and print each result one by one.
    # This function is useful for immediate feedback or incremental output.
    # Replace "example.txt" with the actual search query or file name.
    searchp("example.txt")
   
    # Perform a search using the `searchl` function and obtain the results as a list.
    # This function is useful for scenarios where results need to be processed or manipulated further.
    # Replace "example.txt" with the actual search query or file name.
    results = searchl("example.txt")

    # Print the list of results returned by `searchl`.
    # This allows you to see all results at once after the search is completed.
    print(results)

# Check if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module).
# If true, execute the `main()` function to start the program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
